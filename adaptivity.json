They are responsible for making the visual part of the site functional, intuitive, and easy-to-use for visitors. By following the layout and roadmap set up for the development of a site or an app, they build and maintain these interactive components by constantly improving the site to make it more effective and appealing. This is the job for you if you like to create something from nothing and see it used in the real world.",
            "skills": "Although patience, logic, and pragmatism are often expected from developers, front-end developers must also have a strong sense of design as their work directly impacts the visual identity of brands and websites. Be a bit pragmatic and self-reliant, too, a front-end developer must have a certain awareness of graphics and design. We often have to make small decisions about the interface or re-do what someone else has done. Important prerequisites exist for most front-end developer positions, like full mastery of HTML5 and CSS3 markup elements and Javascript, as well as familiarity with W3C standards. The technologies and practices change often, so you have to stay up to date, and that's not always easy.",
