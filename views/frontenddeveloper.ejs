            <p class ='dummy-text'>FRONT-END DEVELOPERS WRITE THE UI CODE FOR WEBSITES AND
                APPLICATIONS. THEY TAKE CARE OF THE WAY A USER INTERACTS

            <h2 class ='dummy-text'>Missions</h2>
            <p class ='dummy-text'>
                Front-end developers create the codes for displaying a
                website UI and the elements users need to interplay with
                the site. They are responsible for making the visual part
                of the site functional, intuitive, and easy-to-use for
                visitors. By following the layout and roadmap set up for
                the development of a site or an app, they build and
                maintain these interactive components by constantly
                improving the site to make it more effective and
                appealing.
                "This is the job for you if you like to create something
                from nothing and see it used in the real world."</p>

            <h3 class ='dummy-text'>Skills</h3>
            <p class ='dummy-text'>Although patience, logic, and pragmatism are often
            expected from developers, front-end developers must also
            have a strong sense of design as their work directly
            impacts the visual identity of brands and websites.
            "Be a bit pragmatic and self-reliant, too... a front-end
            developer must have a certain awareness of graphics and
            design. We often have to make small decisions about the
            interface or re-do what someone else has done."
            Experiences
            Important prerequisites exist for most front-end
            developer positions, like full mastery of HTML5 and CSS3
            markup elements and Javascript, as well as familiarity with
                W3C standards.</p>
